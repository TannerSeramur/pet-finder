# Perfect Pal
### Author: Tanner Seramur & Caity Heath


### Product Description
Perfect Pal was created out of a desire to encourage people to adopt pups from local shelters and organizations by making the process engaging and highly accessible. Our application uses a familiar UI that makes searching through the pet finder API interactive and fun! Swipe right for the dogs you want to meet and left for the doggos that aren't a good fit for you. Swiping right saves a list of pets so you can find out where they are located and how to contact the shelter for a meeting.
