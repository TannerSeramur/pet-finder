### Author: Tanner Seramur

### Product Description
Perfect Pal was created out of a desire to encourage people to adopt pups from local shelters and organizations by making the process engaging and highly accessible. Our application uses a familiar UI that makes searching through the pet finder API interactive and fun! Swipe right for the dogs you want to save and potentially meet and left for the doggos that aren't a good fit for you.
